 abstract = {Utilizing data on adolescents in secondary school from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), this article examines the link between immigrant generation and adolescent psychological well-being. I find that first-generation immigrants experience less depression and greater positive well-being than their native-born agemates of similar demographic and family backgrounds. Second-generation immigrants, however, do not differ significantly from native-born youth in terms of psychological well-being. A number of family influences serve as “protective” factors that enable first-generation immigrants to maintain their higher levels of well-being. These factors include parental supervision, lack of parent-child conflict, religious practices, and social support. Assimilation among first-generation immigrants, as measured by age at arrival in the U.S., does not significantly affect their positive well-being.},

 abstract = {This study's purpose was to examine the extent to which closeness to family, peers, and school was associated with substance use and school achievement, based on the integrative model of ecological theory, social attachment theory, and social learning theory. A secondary data analysis was conducted on the first wave of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). The final sample yielded 3,147 boys and 3,356 girls.

A structural equation model was employed to test a hypothesized model. School closeness was found to be a primary ecological factor that significantly influenced school achievement while substance use emerged as a critical mediator of this relationship. Family closeness was negatively associated with school achievement. Also, substance use did not have a mediating function in the relationship between peer closeness and school achievement. No gender difference was found, except the relationship between family closeness and school achievement, in that family closeness had a significant, direct effect on school achievement among only boys but not girls.

The findings suggest that schools should strengthen adolescents' tie to school to promote their better academic success and to prevent them from substance use.},

 abstract = {Studies linking the quality of parent-adolescent relationships with young adult health outcomes could inform investments to support these complex relationships.To evaluate whether consistently measured, modifiable characteristics of parent-adolescent relationships are associated with young adult health across multiple domains.This cohort study used data from waves I (1994-1995; ages 12-17 years) and IV (2008-2009; ages 24-32 years) of the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Of 20 745 adolescents enrolled in wave I, 15 701 of 19 560 who were eligible completed wave IV (response rate, 80.3%). Data analyses were conducted from February 2019 to November 2020.Parental warmth, parent-adolescent communication, time together, relationship and communication satisfaction, academic expectations, and maternal inductive discipline as reported at wave I by adolescent participants.Wave IV participant-reported self-rated health, depression, stress, optimism, nicotine dependence, substance abuse symptoms (alcohol, cannabis, or other drugs), unintended pregnancy, romantic relationship quality, physical violence, and alcohol-related injury. Separate regression models were run for mother-adolescent and father-adolescent relationships while controlling for age, biological sex, race and ethnicity, parental educational level, family structure, and child maltreatment experiences.A total of 10 744 participants (mean [SD] age at wave IV, 28.2 [1.8] years; 52.0% female; 67.3% non-Hispanic White) and 8214 participants (mean [SD] age at wave IV, 28.2 [1.8] years; 50.8% female; 71.9% non-Hispanic White) had valid sampling weights and complete data for mother-adolescent and father-adolescent relationship characteristics, respectively. Adolescents who reported higher levels of mother-adolescent warmth (β = 0.11 [95% CI, 0.06-0.15]), communication (β = 0.02 [95% CI, 0.00-0.04]), time together (β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.05-0.09]), academic expectations (β = 0.05 [95% CI, 0.02-0.08]), relationship or communication satisfaction (β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.04-0.10]), and inductive discipline (β = 0.03 [95% CI, 0.01-0.05]) reported significantly higher levels of self-rated general health in young adulthood. Adolescents who reported higher levels of father-adolescent warmth (β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.03-0.11]), communication (β = 0.03 [95% CI, 0.01-0.05]), time together (β = 0.06 [95% CI, 0.03-0.08]), academic expectations (β = 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.06]), and relationship satisfaction (β = 0.07 [95% CI, 0.04-0.10]) also reported significantly higher levels of self-rated general health in young adulthood. Adolescents reporting higher levels of all exposures also reported significantly higher levels of optimism and romantic relationship quality in young adulthood (β coefficient range, 0.02 [95% CI, 0.00-0.04] to 0.24 [95% CI, 0.15-0.34]) and lower levels of stress and depressive symptoms (β coefficient range, −0.07 [95% CI, –0.12 to –0.02] to −0.48 [95% CI, –0.61 to –0.35]). Higher levels of parental warmth, time together, and relationship or communication satisfaction were significantly associated with lower levels of nicotine dependence (odds ratio range, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.72-0.85] to 0.89 [95% CI, 0.81-0.98]) and substance abuse symptoms (incidence rate ratio range, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.50-0.73] to 0.94 [95% CI, 0.89-0.99]), as well as lower odds of unintended pregnancy (odds ratio range, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.74-0.88] to 0.93 [95% CI, 0.86-0.99]). Patterns were less consistent for physical violence and alcohol-related injury. Characteristics of mother-adolescent and father-adolescent relationships were similarly associated with young adult outcomes.The findings of this cohort study suggest that adolescents’ positive perceptions of their relationships with their mothers and fathers are associated with a wide range of favorable outcomes in young adulthood. Investments in improving parent-adolescent relationships may have substantial benefits for young adult population health.},

 abstract = {In the past few decades, there has been a growing interest within the field of criminology in identifying different personality traits associated with victimization. One set of traits that has yet to be fully explored within the victimization literature is callous-unemotional traits. Previous studies that have examined this association have revealed mixed results and have yet to conclusively determine if such a link exists. The current study addresses this gap in the literature by examining the potential link between callous-unemotional traits and victimization while also examining why this association may exist. To do so, we use a longitudinal sample of males and females drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Analyses of these data revealed that callous-unemotional traits were significantly associated with victimization both cross-sectionally and longitudinally (IRR = 1.01–1.10; N = 8682–10,902) and that this association arises from a shared genetic etiology (rA = 0.306–0.663). Once genetic influences were accounted for; however, this association dropped from significance. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of using genetically informed datasets when examining potential risk factors for victimization. Information gleaned from examining the genetic and environmental overlap between traits and the risk for victimization can be used to inform the development of prevention and intervention programs. },

 abstract = {Background: Racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes have been consistently documented in the health literature. Until recently, many studies have evidenced associations between prejudice and health behaviors using cross-sectional data. However, studies assessing the link between school prejudice and health behaviors from adolescence to adulthood are limited. Methods: To address this gap, we use data from Waves I, II, and III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994–2002) to examine how perceptions of school prejudice over time influence cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and marijuana use from adolescence to emerging adulthood. We also examine variation across race and ethnicity. Results: Results indicate that school prejudice in adolescence (Wave I) is associated with higher cigarette use, alcohol use, and marijuana use in later adolescence (Wave II). White and Asian adolescents who perceived school prejudice were more likely to use alcohol, while Hispanic adolescents were more likely to use marijuana. Conclusions: Efforts to reduce school prejudice among adolescents may have implications in reducing substance use.},

 abstract = {Background: Preconception diabetes is strongly associated with adverse birth outcomes. Less is known about the effects of elevated glycemia at levels below clinical cutoffs for diabetes. In this study, we estimated associations between preconception diabetes, prediabetes, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on the risk of preterm birth, and evaluated whether associations were modified by access to or utilization of health care services. Materials and Methods: We used data from Add Health, a US prospective cohort study with five study waves to date. At Wave IV (ages 24-32), glucose and HbA1c were measured. At Wave V (ages 32-42), women with a live birth reported whether the baby was born preterm. The analytic sample size was 1989. Results: The prevalence of preterm birth was 13%. Before pregnancy, 6.9% of women had diabetes, 23.7% had prediabetes, and 69.4% were normoglycemic. Compared to the normoglycemic group, women with diabetes had 2.1 (confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.5-2.9) times the risk of preterm birth, while women with prediabetes had 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0, 1.7) times the risk of preterm birth. There was a nonlinear relationship between HbA1c and preterm birth such that risk of preterm birth emerged after HbA1c = 5.7%, a standard cutoff for prediabetes. The excess risks of preterm birth associated with elevated HbA1c were four to five times larger among women who reported unstable health care coverage and among women who used the emergency room as usual source of care. Conclusion: Our findings replicate prior research showing strong associations between preconception diabetes and preterm birth, adding that prediabetes is also associated with higher risk. Policies and interventions to enhance access and utilization of health care among women before pregnancy should be examined. Copyright © 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

 abstract = {Despite decades of both macro- and micro-level studies showing immigration to be unassociated or negatively linked to crime, research examining the consequences of justice system contact among immigrants has been comparatively underdeveloped. The current study examines whether justice system contact (arrest, probation, and incarceration) is linked to poorer health and, in turn, whether there were differences in how justice system contact is related to immigrant versus native-born health. Using data from multiple waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we construct both ordinal and Poisson regression models predicting poor self-rated health and the prevalence of chronic health conditions for both foreign-born and native-born groups, as well as different generations. The findings suggest important differences by nativity, immigrant generation, and type of justice system contact. Despite lower criminality than the native-born, the health of immigrants is deleteriously impacted by some types of justice system contact, especially incarceration, while probation is more strongly linked to poor health among the native-born. Our findings carry implications for the provision of care for individuals with histories of criminal justice involvement, as well as academic research examining the consequences of justice contact and the immigration–crime nexus.},

 abstract = {General strain theory maintains that the likelihood that individuals engage in deviance to cope with negative emotions is conditioned by several factors, including social support. Yet, this tenet of the theory receives mixed support and few have considered factors important to life course theorists as moderators. Using data from Add Health (N = 10,044), this study uses moderated-mediation techniques to examine if relationships between victimization as a source of strain and recent substance use are mediated by negative emotions, and the extent to which processes are moderated by marital status and relationship quality. Supporting general strain theory, findings show that the relationship between victimization and recent substance use was mediated by negative emotions. Results also provide evidence of moderated-mediation as the partial relationship between negative emotions and recent substance use varied by marital status.},

 abstract = {Health is strongly and positively correlated with education, which is one of many reasons to better understand the determinants of education. In this paper, we test for a specific type of family influence on education: genetic nurture. Specifically, we test whether a person’s educational attainment is correlated with their sibling’s polygenic score (PGS) for education, controlling for their own PGS. Models estimated using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) yield strong evidence of genetic nurture; a two-standard deviation increase in a sibling’s genetic predisposition to higher education is associated with a 13.6% point increase in the probability that the respondent has a college degree. Evidence of genetic nurture is robust to alternative measures of educational attainment and different measures of the polygenic score. An exploration of mechanisms suggests that omission of parental PGS explains no more than half of the estimated effect, and that the magnitude of the genetic nurture varies with the characteristics of the sibling.},

 abstract = {The origin of values and preferences is an unresolved theoretical problem in social and behavioral sciences. The Savanna–IQ Interaction Hypothesis suggests that more intelligent individuals are more likely to acquire and espouse evolutionarily novel values and preferences than less intelligent individuals, but general intelligence has no effect on the acquisition and espousal of evolutionarily familiar values and preferences. Individuals can often choose their values and preferences even in the face of genetic predisposition. One example of such choice within genetic constraint is circadian rhythms. Survey of ethnographies of traditional societies suggests that nocturnal activities were probably rare in the ancestral environment, so the Hypothesis would predict that more intelligent individuals are more likely to be nocturnal than less intelligent individuals. The analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) confirms the prediction.},
